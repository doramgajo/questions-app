**Questions** is a 'true or false' questions app. It has timer, difficulty,
statistics, random questions, possibility to add new questions and local
persistence.

The project was builtusingn **Kotlin** in **Android Studio**.

> [!NOTE]  
This application was developed during my time as a student, under a tight
deadline and while managing other projects. It offers the core functionality,
but you may encounter bugs, rough edges, and code thatâ€™s not production-ready.
